    "content": "Hans Mueller opens the door to his glass-walled kitchen for an unprecedented deep dive into laminated dough. This extended masterclass reveals the science, technique, and obsessive attention to detail behind his legendary 288-layer croissant.\n\n## What You'll Learn\n\n**The Science of Lamination**\nHans has collaborated with food scientists to understand exactly what happens during lamination at the molecular level. Learn why butter temperature matters down to the degree, how gluten networks interact with fat layers, and the physics of steam expansion that creates those honeycomb interiors.\n\n**Détrempe: The Foundation**\nThe dough itself sets the stage for everything that follows. Hans demonstrates his approach to mixing, explaining his flour choices, hydration levels, and the brief fermentation that develops flavor without compromising structure.\n\n**The Beurrage: Butter Block Preparation**\nSelecting and preparing butter is where many croissants fail before they've begun. Hans shares his butter blend (yes, he combines varieties), his method for creating a perfectly pliable block, and how to match butter and dough temperatures for seamless integration.\n\n**Folding Technique**\nWatch as Hans performs his signature fold sequence, explaining each turn, each rest period, and how to recognize when your dough is speaking to you. He'll address common problems — butter breaking through, layers merging, uneven thickness — and their solutions.\n\n**Shaping & Proofing**\nFrom rolling the final sheet to cutting perfect triangles and forming the classic crescent shape. Hans discusses proofing temperatures and times, and how to know when your croissants are ready for the oven.\n\n## Live Demonstration\n\nHans will laminate dough in real-time, narrating each step and taking questions. Pre-laminated dough will be available for participants to practice shaping.\n\n## Who Should Attend\n\nThis session is designed for serious pastry professionals and ambitious home bakers who are ready to invest the time required for true mastery. Prior experience with laminated doughs is helpful but not required — only patience and dedication.\n\n*\"The croissant demands everything from the baker — time, precision, attention. In return, it offers transcendence.\"* — Hans Mueller",

In this comprehensive session, she shares the methods that produce consistent, beautiful macarons at Pâtisserie Célestine — and troubleshoots the many ways they can go wrong.\n\n## What You'll Learn\n\n**Understanding Macaron Science**\nWhy are macarons so finicky? Marie explains the science behind meringue stability, the role of almond flour particle size, and how humidity, temperature, and timing interact to determine success or failure. Understanding the \"why\" makes the \"how\" much easier.\n\n**French vs. Italian Meringue Method**\nMarie demonstrates both approaches, explaining when she chooses each method and why. You'll see the differences in technique, texture, and final result — and understand which approach might suit your kitchen environment.\n\n**The Perfect Macaronage**\nThe moment of folding is where most macarons are won or lost. Marie shares her visual and tactile cues for knowing when the batter has reached the ideal consistency — that magical point between over-mixed and under-mixed.\n\n**Piping & Baking**\nFrom piping uniform circles to achieving the coveted \"feet,\" Marie walks through her entire baking process. Learn her resting times, oven temperatures, and how to adjust for different environments and equipment.\n\n**Filling Philosophy**\nA macaron is only as good as its filling. Marie demonstrates several of her signature ganaches and buttercreams, discussing flavor pairing, texture balance, and how to match filling to shell color and flavor.\n\n## Troubleshooting Workshop\n\nBring your macaron problems to Marie. She'll address common issues — hollow shells, cracked tops, missing feet, lopsided shapes — with specific solutions based on her years of professional production.\n\n## Who Should Attend\n\nAnyone who has ever sworn off macarons after too many failures, professionals looking to add macarons to their offerings, and bakers who want to understand these confections at a deeper level. Intermediate skill level recommended.\n\n*\"The macaron teaches patience and precision. Master it, and every other pastry becomes simpler by comparison.\"* — Marie Dubois",

    "content": "Kenji Nakamura challenges the Western assumption that desserts must be purely sweet. In this boundary-pushing session, he reveals how umami — the fifth taste — can add depth, complexity, and surprise to pastry in ways that delight rather than confuse.\n\n## What You'll Learn\n\n**Understanding Umami in Sweet Contexts**\nUmami isn't new to desserts — it's in caramel's maillard compounds, in aged cheeses paired with honey, in chocolate's fermented origins. Kenji reframes how we think about savory-sweet intersections, building a vocabulary for intentional umami use in pastry.\n\n**The Japanese Ingredient Palette**\nFrom white miso to toasted nori, from dashi to fermented black beans, Japanese cuisine offers a rich array of umami-forward ingredients. Kenji demonstrates how to introduce these flavors at levels that intrigue rather than overwhelm — the subtle art of restraint.\n\n**Miso Caramel: A Case Study**\nKenji walks through his signature miso caramel, explaining ingredient ratios, cooking temperatures, and the balance point where salinity and umami enhance sweetness. This versatile sauce becomes a gateway to understanding umami integration.\n\n**Matcha Beyond Green**\nCeremonial-grade matcha offers more than color and bitterness. Kenji explores its umami character and demonstrates applications in cream, ganache, and his signature millefeuille — showing how proper matcha use differs from the commodity powder found in most Western applications.\n\n**Fermentation in Desserts**\nDrawing on Japanese traditions of fermented foods, Kenji discusses how controlled fermentation can add complexity to pastry components, from amazake-sweetened creams to koji-aged nut pralines.\n\n## Tasting Experience\n\nParticipants will taste a progression of Kenji's creations, from subtle umami accents to more pronounced expressions, understanding how different applications affect perception.\n\n## Who Should Attend\n\nAdventurous pastry professionals, chefs interested in cross-cultural fusion, and anyone curious about expanding the flavor possibilities of dessert. Open minds required; open palates will follow.\n\n*\"Umami is not about making desserts savory — it is about making them complete.\"* — Kenji Nakamura",
