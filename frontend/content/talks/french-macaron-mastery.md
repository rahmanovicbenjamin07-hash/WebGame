Marie Dubois confronts the pastry world's most temperamental confection: the French macaron. In this comprehensive session, she shares the methods that produce consistent, beautiful macarons at Pâtisserie Célestine — and troubleshoots the many ways they can go wrong.

## What You'll Learn

**Understanding Macaron Science**
Why are macarons so finicky? Marie explains the science behind meringue stability, the role of almond flour particle size, and how humidity, temperature, and timing interact to determine success or failure. Understanding the "why" makes the "how" much easier.

**French vs. Italian Meringue Method**
Marie demonstrates both approaches, explaining when she chooses each method and why. You'll see the differences in technique, texture, and final result — and understand which approach might suit your kitchen environment.

**The Perfect Macaronage**
The moment of folding is where most macarons are won or lost. Marie shares her visual and tactile cues for knowing when the batter has reached the ideal consistency — that magical point between over-mixed and under-mixed.

**Piping & Baking**
From piping uniform circles to achieving the coveted "feet," Marie walks through her entire baking process. Learn her resting times, oven temperatures, and how to adjust for different environments and equipment.

**Filling Philosophy**
A macaron is only as good as its filling. Marie demonstrates several of her signature ganaches and buttercreams, discussing flavor pairing, texture balance, and how to match filling to shell color and flavor.

## Troubleshooting Workshop

Bring your macaron problems to Marie. She'll address common issues — hollow shells, cracked tops, missing feet, lopsided shapes — with specific solutions based on her years of professional production.

## Who Should Attend

Anyone who has ever sworn off macarons after too many failures, professionals looking to add macarons to their offerings, and bakers who want to understand these confections at a deeper level. Intermediate skill level recommended.

*"The macaron teaches patience and precision. Master it, and every other pastry becomes simpler by comparison."* — Marie Dubois
