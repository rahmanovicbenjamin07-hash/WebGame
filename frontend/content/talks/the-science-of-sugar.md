Priya Sharma merges her biochemistry background with pastry artistry to demystify sugar — the ingredient that defines confectionery. This session transforms abstract chemistry into practical knowledge that will change how you approach every sweet creation.

## What You'll Learn

**Sugar States & Stages**
From thread to hard crack, sugar undergoes dramatic transformations as temperature rises. Priya explains exactly what's happening at the molecular level during each stage, why precise temperature control matters, and how to recognize stages by sight and sound when your thermometer fails.

**Crystallization: Friend and Foe**
Sometimes we want crystals (fondant, fudge); sometimes we don't (caramel, hard candy). Priya explores the science of nucleation and crystal growth, teaching you how to encourage or prevent crystallization intentionally rather than by accident.

**Caramelization Chemistry**
The browning of sugar involves hundreds of chemical reactions creating thousands of flavor compounds. Priya breaks down this complexity into understandable principles, explaining why dry caramel differs from wet, why added ingredients change the process, and how to achieve specific flavor profiles.

**Modern Sugar Techniques**
From isomalt for humidity-resistant sugar work to glucose syrup for flexibility, Priya explores the modern pastry chef's expanded sugar toolkit. She demonstrates techniques including sugar glass, pulled sugar basics, and her signature "sugar clouds" — impossibly thin, shattered caramel sheets.

**Sugar Alternatives & Reductions**
How do alternative sweeteners behave differently from sucrose? Priya discusses the chemistry of honey, maple, coconut sugar, and modern alternatives, and how to adjust recipes when reducing sugar content without sacrificing texture.

## Live Demonstrations

Watch Priya work sugar through multiple stages, creating components for her signature desserts while explaining the science in real-time.

## Who Should Attend

Pastry professionals who want to understand their most important ingredient at a deeper level, curious bakers tired of following sugar recipes blindly, and anyone who has ever overcooked caramel and wondered exactly where they went wrong. All skill levels welcome.

*"Sugar is not merely sweet — it is structure, texture, color, and flavor. Understanding its chemistry unlocks infinite possibilities."* — Priya Sharma
