Isabella Martinez invites you into the living world of sourdough — where flour, water, and time create something almost magical. This extended session covers the complete journey from cultivating a starter to pulling a perfectly blistered loaf from the oven.

## What You'll Learn

**Understanding Your Starter**
Isabella maintains over twenty sourdough cultures from around the world. She'll explain the microbiology behind fermentation, how different flour types and environments create distinct flavor profiles, and share her daily feeding ritual that keeps her starters thriving for years.

**The Science of Fermentation**
Why does long fermentation create better bread? Isabella breaks down the enzymatic processes, the development of organic acids, and how time transforms simple ingredients into complex flavors. You'll learn to read the signs that tell you when your dough is ready.

**Shaping & Scoring**
The moment of truth: turning a mass of dough into a beautiful loaf. Isabella demonstrates her signature shaping techniques for boules and batards, and reveals how she approaches scoring — treating each loaf as a canvas for artistic expression.

**The Bake**
From oven temperature to steam injection, the final stage determines whether your loaf achieves that coveted ear, the crackled crust, and the open crumb structure. Isabella shares her methods for both professional deck ovens and home Dutch oven baking.

## Hands-On Component

Participants will work with pre-fermented dough to practice shaping and scoring techniques. Isabella will provide feedback on form and approach.

## Who Should Attend

Perfect for bread enthusiasts at any level who want to deepen their understanding of natural leavening. Whether you're troubleshooting your home starter or looking to add sourdough to your bakery menu, this session provides both scientific grounding and practical wisdom.

*"Every loaf of sourdough carries within it the history of bread itself — a connection to every baker who came before."* — Isabella Martinez
