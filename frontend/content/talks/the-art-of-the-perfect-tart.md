Join Marie Dubois for an immersive journey into the soul of French pâtisserie — the tart. In this masterclass, Marie will reveal the techniques that have made her Tarte Céleste a destination dessert, breaking down each component from crust to crown.

## What You'll Learn

**The Foundation: Pâte Sucrée & Pâte Sablée**
Marie will demonstrate her approach to creating two essential tart doughs. You'll understand why she chills her butter to exactly 4°C, how to achieve the ideal "sandy" texture in sablée, and the resting times that separate good crusts from transcendent ones.

**Blind Baking Perfection**
The difference between a soggy bottom and a crisp, golden shell lies in technique. Marie shares her method for achieving uniform baking, including her unconventional approach to pie weights and her timing secrets.

**Filling Philosophy**
From silky pastry cream to fresh fruit arrangements, Marie discusses how to balance flavors, textures, and visual appeal. She'll prepare her signature fig and honey lavender cream filling live, explaining each decision along the way.

**Assembly & Finishing**
The final touches transform a tart from homemade to haute cuisine. Learn Marie's glazing techniques, her approach to garnishing, and how she creates the signature "Célestine" finish.

## Who Should Attend

This session is ideal for pastry professionals looking to refine their technique, serious home bakers ready to elevate their craft, and anyone who believes that the tart is the highest expression of French pastry artistry. Intermediate skill level recommended.

*"A tart is not a vessel for filling — it is a complete composition where every element must sing in harmony."* — Marie Dubois
