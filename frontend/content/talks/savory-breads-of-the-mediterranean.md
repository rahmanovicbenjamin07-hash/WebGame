André Costa takes you on a journey around the Mediterranean Sea, exploring the savory bread traditions that have sustained cultures for millennia. From Portuguese broa to Moroccan msemen, this session celebrates the diversity and commonality of Mediterranean baking.

## What You'll Learn

**The Mediterranean Grain Tradition**
André explores how geography, climate, and trade shaped bread cultures around the Mediterranean. Understanding these connections helps us appreciate why certain techniques developed in specific regions — and how they can inform our own baking today.

**Portuguese Broa de Milho**
Portugal's beloved corn bread predates the introduction of wheat and remains a staple of northern Portuguese cuisine. André demonstrates the traditional method, explaining how to achieve the dense, slightly sweet crumb that makes broa the perfect companion for caldo verde.

**Moroccan Msemen**
These layered, pan-fried flatbreads share surprising similarities with laminated Viennoiserie — a connection André discovered during his Mediterranean travels. Learn the hand technique for stretching the dough paper-thin and the folding method that creates flaky layers.

**Focaccia Genovese**
The art of focaccia lies in the olive oil — its quality, quantity, and application. André shares his approach to this seemingly simple bread, achieving the crispy-bottomed, dimpled, olive-oil-soaked perfection that defines Ligurian tradition.

**Pide & Beyond**
A brief exploration of Turkish pide and how Eastern Mediterranean traditions connect back to Portuguese influences, completing the circle around the sea.

## Tasting Session

Samples of each bread discussed will be available for participants to taste and compare, understanding how ingredients and technique create distinct regional characters.

## Who Should Attend

Ideal for bakers interested in expanding beyond French and American bread traditions, food historians, and anyone who believes that understanding bread is understanding culture. All skill levels welcome.

*"The Mediterranean is connected by wheat, water, and olive oil — and by the hands that have shaped bread along its shores for thousands of years."* — André Costa
