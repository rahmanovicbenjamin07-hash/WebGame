Hans Mueller opens the door to his glass-walled kitchen for an unprecedented deep dive into laminated dough. This extended masterclass reveals the science, technique, and obsessive attention to detail behind his legendary 288-layer croissant.

## What You'll Learn

**The Science of Lamination**
Hans has collaborated with food scientists to understand exactly what happens during lamination at the molecular level. Learn why butter temperature matters down to the degree, how gluten networks interact with fat layers, and the physics of steam expansion that creates those honeycomb interiors.

**Détrempe: The Foundation**
The dough itself sets the stage for everything that follows. Hans demonstrates his approach to mixing, explaining his flour choices, hydration levels, and the brief fermentation that develops flavor without compromising structure.

**The Beurrage: Butter Block Preparation**
Selecting and preparing butter is where many croissants fail before they've begun. Hans shares his butter blend (yes, he combines varieties), his method for creating a perfectly pliable block, and how to match butter and dough temperatures for seamless integration.

**Folding Technique**
Watch as Hans performs his signature fold sequence, explaining each turn, each rest period, and how to recognize when your dough is speaking to you. He'll address common problems — butter breaking through, layers merging, uneven thickness — and their solutions.

**Shaping & Proofing**
From rolling the final sheet to cutting perfect triangles and forming the classic crescent shape. Hans discusses proofing temperatures and times, and how to know when your croissants are ready for the oven.

## Live Demonstration

Hans will laminate dough in real-time, narrating each step and taking questions. Pre-laminated dough will be available for participants to practice shaping.

## Who Should Attend

This session is designed for serious pastry professionals and ambitious home bakers who are ready to invest the time required for true mastery. Prior experience with laminated doughs is helpful but not required — only patience and dedication.

*"The croissant demands everything from the baker — time, precision, attention. In return, it offers transcendence."* — Hans Mueller
