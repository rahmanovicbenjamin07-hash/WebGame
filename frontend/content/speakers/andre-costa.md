André Costa is the guardian of Portugal's rich pastry heritage and an ambassador for Mediterranean bread traditions. His life's work has been dedicated to preserving, perfecting, and sharing the techniques behind iconic Portuguese sweets — from the legendary pastel de nata to the lesser-known regional treasures that deserve global recognition.

André's training began at age sixteen at Pastéis de Belém, the historic Lisbon bakery that has guarded the original pastel de nata recipe since 1837. For twelve years, he worked within their closely guarded production, eventually becoming one of only a handful of people entrusted with the complete, secret recipe. The discipline and precision required to produce thousands of identical custard tarts daily became the foundation of his craft.

But André's curiosity extended beyond Lisbon. He spent years traveling the Mediterranean coast — from the Algarve to Morocco, Sicily to Lebanon — studying the bread traditions that connect these cultures. He became fascinated by how similar techniques evolved differently across regions, and how the sea, the wheat, and the olive oil created distinct but related culinary identities.

Pastelaria Ouro, opened in Lisbon's Alfama district in 2018, showcases both Portuguese classics and André's Mediterranean discoveries. The morning pastry case features perfect pastéis de nata alongside Sicilian brioche, Moroccan msemen, and his own creations that blend traditions. The afternoon bread service offers naturally leavened loaves baked in a wood-fired oven built to his specifications.

André is also a passionate historian, having written two books on Portuguese pastry traditions and consulting for UNESCO on the cultural preservation of Mediterranean baking heritage.
