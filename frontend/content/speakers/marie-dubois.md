Marie Dubois has been crafting exquisite French pastries for over two decades, earning her place among the world's most celebrated pâtissiers. Her journey began at the prestigious Le Cordon Bleu in Paris, where she graduated top of her class before apprenticing at Maison Ladurée under their master pastry team.

After eight years perfecting the art of delicate French confections, Marie joined the legendary Pierre Hermé Paris, where she helped develop new flavor combinations that would become instant classics. Her innovative approach to traditional French pastry caught the attention of the culinary world, leading to features in *Bon Appétit*, *Saveur*, and the *New York Times*.

In 2018, Marie opened Pâtisserie Célestine in the heart of Paris's 6th arrondissement. The intimate shop has since earned two Michelin stars for its attached restaurant and is consistently ranked among the top pastry destinations in Europe. Her signature creation, the "Tarte Céleste" — a delicate fusion of caramelized fig, honey lavender cream, and a buttery sablé crust — has become a pilgrimage-worthy destination for pastry lovers worldwide.

Marie is known for her meticulous attention to detail, her insistence on seasonal ingredients, and her ability to elevate simple French classics into transcendent experiences. She has mentored over thirty pastry chefs who now lead kitchens across three continents.
